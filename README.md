# Quick Pick
In this example, we have two classes: `LotteryCard` representing a lottery card with 10 random quick picks, and `LotteryDrawing` representing a lottery drawing with winning numbers. The program generates a lottery card, draws winning numbers, and checks if the card has any winning numbers.
